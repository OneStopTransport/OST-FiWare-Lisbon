Python connector between One.Stop.Transport and FI-WARE Orion Context Broker


## FI-WARE Lisbon use case

Integration project between [One.Stop.Transport](https://ost.pt) and [FI-WARE](http://fi-ware.org). This application fetches GTFS data from One.Stop.Transport's [APIs](https://developer.ost.pt/api-explorer/) and inserts it into an [Orion Context Broker](http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/configuration-manager-orion-context-broker) instance.

---

## Setup

This is a Python project that can be run as a [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) worker.

#### Requirements

- **[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7)**
- **[Pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html)**

#### "Should I use a virtual environment?"

**YES**. It's strongly recommended to use a [virtual environment tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_environment_software) to control the libraries' versions. We suggest **[pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)** with **[pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv)**, but other solutions may suit you.

#### Installation

After setting that up and creating a `virtualenv` for this project, install its libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.pip
```

...and that's it.

## Usage

As stated before, this project fetches data from OST and inserts it into a Context Broker instance. For it to work, we need a Context Broker running on FI-WARE and a suitable API Key to be used with OST. 

#### Requirements

- [OST](https://www.ost.pt) developer account (Sign up > Login > Settings > Developer Settings) ;
- [OST Server API Key](https://github.com/OneStopTransport/OneStopTransport/wiki/Autenticac%CC%A7a%CC%83o-por-chave);
- [Orion Context Broker](http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/configuration-manager-orion-context-broker) instance running on FI-WARE with a public IP (check the [wiki](https://git.tice.ipn.pt/rvitorino/fi-ware-lisbon/wikis/home) for details);
- [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) instance if you want this being run as a [Celery Beat Worker](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html);


#### Environment variables

For security reasons, all the confidential data (such as the API Key or the Context Broker Host) were not added to the project's repository, since they're retrieved from the system's environment. If you'll be running this project on an Unix system, you can the put the following lines on the `~/.exports` file or in one of the following: `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:

```
# One.Stop.Transport API Keys 
export OST_SERVER_KEY="<INSERT_API_KEY_HERE>"
export FIWARE_HOST="<INSERT_CONTEXTBROKER_IP_HERE>"
```

`FIWARE_HOST` can be an IP address or an URL, but don't forget the 1026 port, which is needed for the ContextBroker operations.

If you'll be running this as a [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) worker, you'll need this too:
```
# RabbitMQ credentials and URLs
export MQ_HOST_PROD="messaging.vhost.ost.pt"		# Only if you're running this on the OST architecture
export MQ_HOST_TEST="<INSERT_RABBITMQ_HOST_HERE>"
export MQ_USER="<INSERT_MQ_USER_HERE>"
export MQ_PASSWORD="<INSERT_MQ_PASSWORD_HERE>"
export MQ_VHOST="/"
```

#### Running the project

There are two procedures, one if you'll use this as a regular Python project or as a periodic [Celery Beat worker](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html).

#### - Regular Python project

Just run the following on the project's directory (fi-ware-lisbon):

```
python -m fiware.tasks
```

#### - Celery Beat 

Just run the following on the project's directory (fi-ware-lisbon):

```
celeryd -B -Q fiware_queue
```

And it will transfer the data at 6:30 AM every day!
